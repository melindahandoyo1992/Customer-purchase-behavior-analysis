# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer purchase behavior to gain a deeper understanding of how customers in different segments behave in terms of purchase timing, frequency, and revenue.

The goal is to generate actionable insights through exploratory data analysis in order to better understand customer behavior and support customer engagement and retention strategies.

## Business Questions

The analysis aims to answer the following questions : 
  - How loyal are the customers?
  - How does customer value differ across segments?
  - How do customers behave in each segment in terms of purchase timing, frequency, and revenue?
  - How do customers behave in terms of product selection, order timing, and repeat purchases?
  - What strategies are most appropriate for each customer segment?
  
## Data and Methodology

- **Data source:** Transaction-level purchase data
- **Segmentation method:** RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scoring
- **Analytical focus:**
    - Purchase frequency by segment
    - Average time between orders
    - Repeat purchase behavior
    - Product category contribution by segment

Customers were segmented using RFM scores to provide a structured and interpretable view of behavioral differences.

## Key Insight

Customer segments demonstrate distinct purchase behaviors, particularly in terms of purchase timing and frequency.

Notably :

- At-risk customers exhibit the longest average time between orders, indicating irregular purchase cadence and declining engagement despite prior activity.
- New/recent customers show the shortest days between orders, reflecting early-stage engagement rather than sustained frequency.
- Champions combine the highest order frequency with relatively stable purchase cadence.
- Purchase preferences vary across segments, suggesting different product affinities and engagement patterns.

These differences suggest that customer segments should not be treated uniformly and require segment-specific engagement approaches.

## Business Implications

  -	Customer strategies should be tailored based on the needs of each segment
  -	At-risk customers require targeted engagement to prevent churn
  -	Potential loyalists may benefit from re-engagement strategies to move into the Loyal segment
  -	Loyal customers should be maintained and gradually developed into Champion customers through retention strategies
  -	Champion customers should be prioritized through rewards and loyalty programs
